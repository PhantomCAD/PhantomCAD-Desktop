# PhantomCAD-Desktop

Welcome to the PhantomCAD Desktop application repository! This repository contains the application files for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Installing the Desktop Application

At PhantomCAD, we believe in full transparency and giving you complete control over the application. That's why there's no installerâ€”just the application files.

### Requirements

To extract the application files, you'll need a .rar extractor such as WinRAR or any other suitable software.

### Windows

1. Download and extract the `.rar` file.
2. Place the extracted folder anywhere you like on your system.
3. Open the folder and run the `.exe` file, or create a shortcut to the `.exe` on your desktop for easy access.

### Linux

1. Download and extract the folder.
2. Locate the Linux executable within the extracted folder and run it.

### macOS

Unfortunately, we've encountered some difficulties with the macOS version. It's not available just yet, but we're working on it and hope to release it soon.
